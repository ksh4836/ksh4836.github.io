                        <p> One of the most basic item you need will be a good working desktop or a laptop. For portability, the best hardware you could choose will be a carriable laptop. For beginners, if you want to start with controllers, you will only need usb connector and a controller. However, if you want to have a classic fancy set up with seperate CDJs and Mixers, you might have to get a interface to connect the mixer to the laptop. </p></div>copyright:The DJ HookUp

                            <p> The classic setup will require CDJs and a mixer in the middle. You can have multiple CDJs usually up to four in a DJ set. However, there is no limited number it. The overall set up will look like the image above. Usually, the mixer is put in the middle. According to the mixer you choose, the maximum number of CDJs you can connect to the mixer varies. The most basic set up will have two mixsets, but a lot of DJs often use 4 CDJs sets as well. </p>

                        <p> If you are a begginer and don't want to spend too much money on equipments, you can have DJ controllers. DJ controllers are the simplest all in one equipments you can have. Instead of a preparing a whole set of CDJs and mixers, you can buy controllers with its own little turntables and mixers with more reasonable price. A lot of professional DJs choose to use DJ controllers. The price of DJ controllers vary according to its functions and quality. Pioneer's DDJ series and Numark's mix track series are good examples of all in one controllers with low prices. If you want some high-end controllers with more functions, Pioneer's XDJ and Numark's NS7III are good examples.</p>
